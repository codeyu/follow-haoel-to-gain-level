## [743. Network Delay Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/)

### 题目描述
There are `N` network nodes, labelled `1` to `N`.

Given `times`, a list of travel times as **directed** edges `times[i] = (u, v, w)`, where `u` is the source node, `v` is the target node, and `w` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node `K`. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return `-1`.

**Note:**
1. `N` will be in the range `[1, 100]`.
2. `K` will be in the range [1, N].
3. The length of `times` will be in the range `[1, 6000]`.
4. All edges `times[i] = (u, v, w)` will have `1 <= u, v <= N` and `1 <= w <= 100`.
### 解题思路


### 实现代码

#### go
```go
package main
func networkDelayTime(times [][]int, N int, K int) int {
    
}

```
